    <h2>About the Author</h2>
   <p>Dr. Allen E. Goldenthal is an author, scientist, and global thinker whose work bridges the worlds of fiction and reality. With a doctorate in biotechnology and decades of experience in scientific and public health leadership, Dr. Goldenthal has published extensively in academic and professional settings. His transition into fiction and narrative nonfiction reflects a deep passion for exploring the moral, philosophical, and spiritual questions of our time. Whether unraveling the mysteries of ancient genealogies, charting speculative futures, or delving into prophetic symbolism, his books are marked by rigorous research, vivid imagination, and a profound empathy for the human condition.
    <hr />
 <p>Dr. Allen E. Goldenthal works and writes from his homes in New Zealand and China. As an internationally known consultant and auditor of the biopharmaceutical industry, his work has taken him across the globe, but no matter where he may be, New Zealand is always home. He is the author of the Kahana Chronicles series, uncovering the hidden influence of a family who shaped history from the shadows. This series is more than fiction—it's a personal journey, as Dr. Goldenthal is a descendant of the Kahana.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Allen Goldenthal initially trained as a veterinarian, though unlike James Herriot, never felt compelled to write about animals. Born in Canada, he sought warmer climates and found his paradise in New Zealand. His passion for research led him through academic posts at Massey University and the University of Macau, executive leadership in biopharma, and now, global auditing for drug safety. He divides time between his farm in Whangarei, New Zealand and his home in Panzhihua, China. His genealogical investigations into the Kahana family—figures long hidden by history—serve as the foundation for his Kahana Chronicles series.</p>

        <h3>America's War Against the Jews</h3>
        <p><em>America’s War Against the Jews</em> explores the persistent, evolving nature of antisemitism within the United States. From early colonial prejudice to today’s politically charged rhetoric, Dr. Goldenthal traces how anti-Jewish hatred has adapted to shifting societal norms. While criticism of Israeli policy may be legitimate, it often morphs into calls for the annihilation of the Jewish state—something no other ethnicity faces on the world stage. In doing so, anti-Zionism reveals itself not as a political stance, but as a modern mask for ancient hatred.</p>
        <p>Through historical analysis, cultural critique, and recorded documents, the book follows the transformation of antisemitism over generations: from religious blame to accusations of elitism, from scapegoating to envy of success. The Jewish people have been condemned for remaining apart—then equally condemned for integrating. Now, their longing for a homeland is maligned as oppression. This book lays bare the contradictions, and asks a difficult question: has America truly been a safe haven, or just a more polite battlefield?  The answers in the book may even surprise those Jews living in American that have never bothered to search for the truth.</p>

    <p>Born into a priestly lineage, young Joseph ben Matthias is sent by the religious court to free Jewish captives in Rome. But once there, he realizes the mission is far more complex—and possibly a ruse. As political tension mounts in the East, Josephus finds himself torn between allegiance to Rome, love for an empress, and the looming threat of Nero's brutal purges. What begins as duty becomes a test of survival—and conscience.</p>

    <p>After the Great Exile of 70 AD, a remnant of Jews remained in the land—wounded but unbroken. In 132 AD, under the charismatic and mysterious Simon Bar Kochba, they rose once more, believing they had found their messiah. For three years they held their own against Rome, nearly forcing Emperor Hadrian into submission. But in the final days, betrayal came not from the enemy—but from within. The man still hailed as the savior of Judaism may in fact have sealed its fate.</p>

    <p><strong>New Release – June 13, 2025:</strong> In the brutal twilight of the Northern Wei dynasty, empires fracture and legends rise. <em>The Glittering Man</em> follows the unlikely rise of Mar Yanqa, a fifteen-year-old Khitan chieftain descended from steppe warriors and both eastern and western imperial blood. As rival clans, secretive priests, and decaying dynasties vie for control of China’s vast frontiers, Mar Yanqa must forge unity through honor, cunning, and a legacy not entirely his own.</p>
    <p>At his side stands Alan Ko, a widowed mother empowered with the fire of the old Khitan spirit, whose love and wisdom shape the course of destiny. Together they navigate prophecy, betrayal, and the relentless ambitions of generals and emperors. At the center is Mar Yanqa—the Glittering Man—a religious warrior whose jeweled robe beguiles his enemies and whose origins may unravel empires.</p>
    <p>As the mighty Wei empire crumbles, the battle for the soul of the steppes and the future of the Middle Kingdom has begun.</p>

    <h3>Shadows of Trinity</h3>
    <p><em>Darkness stalks Prague in a time of superstition, power, and blood.</em></p>
    <p><strong>Book 10 of the Kahana Chronicles:</strong> In the year of the Lord 1588, the city of Prague was held in the grip of terror, victim to the murderous rampage of an inhuman monster created from the seeds of hatred and sown through religious intolerance and mortal greed.</p>
    <p>If the Empire was to survive, it had to place its hopes of salvation in the hands of three men: a heretical priest, a failed prophet, and a king without a kingdom. *Shadows of Trinity* is a haunting blend of historical fiction and gothic mystery.</p>

    <h3>Blood of Trinity</h3>
    <p><em>The legacy of the Golem returns—Transylvania trembles once again.</em></p>
    <p><strong>Book 11 of the Kahana Chronicles:</strong> Almost 20 years after the Golem’s reign of terror threatened the Habsburg Empire, a new disaster looms. Once again, the prophecy of Nostradamus declares that only a trinity of outcasts can prevent the coming Armageddon.</p>
    <p>A false prophet, a heretic priest, and a king without a kingdom—three men the Empire has scorned—must unite to confront supernatural evil and unravel terrifying legends born in the shadows of Transylvania. As myth and prophecy entwine, they are all that stands between order and utter ruin.</p>

    <h3>Phantoms of Trinity</h3>
    <p><em>When darkness walks among men, only the ancient prophecy can bring salvation.</em></p>
    <p><strong>Book 12 of the Kahana Chronicles:</strong> More than a century has passed since the last invocation of the Trinity. But now, in the terror-stricken south-western districts of the Empire, livestock are mutilated and young girls vanish without a trace. Whispers of phantoms and shadows haunt the land.</p>
    <p>Austria’s newly crowned emperor, burdened by the divisive legacy of Maria Theresa, must mend a fractured people and face an evil that thrives on their disunity. When depraved humans form unholy pacts with dark forces, the Church and Crown have only one option: to resurrect the Trinity foretold in prophecy—a false prophet, a failed priest, and a king without a kingdom.</p>

    <h3>Vienna's Last Waltz</h3>
    <p><em>The end of the Trinity Trilogy. The beginning of the final curse.</em></p>
    <p><strong>Book 13 of the Kahana Chronicles:</strong> So many secrets. So many lies. So many deaths. This is the true legacy of the Habsburg Empire. In this explosive conclusion to the Trinity Trilogy, the final horror of the Kahana-Habsburg prophecy is unveiled—a curse forged by betrayal, bound by love, and sealed by blood.</p>
    <p>Two houses were destined to endure only if neither betrayed the other. But love, twisted by ambition and desire, knows no loyalty. As truths emerge and loyalties fracture, the author’s third great-grandfather becomes the instrument of a prophecy that will destroy everything. The waltz has ended. The curse has begun.</p>
